I am a third-year PhD student at the <a href='https://www.cics.umass.edu/'>College of Information and Computer Sciences (CICS)</a>  in University of Massachusetts Amherst, advised by <a href='https://people.cs.umass.edu/~dganesan/'>Prof. Deepak K. Ganesan</a>. My research interest broadly are Wireless Communication, Electromagnetics, and 3D Computer Vision. My current research focuses on buidling building real-time AR/VR systems, particularly optimizing them for resource constrained environments, where the main objective is to reduce the latency while preserving a satisfactory visual quality.
