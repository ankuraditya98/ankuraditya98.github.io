I am a third-year MS/PhD student at the <a href='https://www.cics.umass.edu/'>College of Information and Computer Sciences (CICS)</a> in University of Massachusetts Amherst, advised by <a href='https://people.cs.umass.edu/~dganesan/'>Prof. Deepak K. Ganesan</a>. My research interest broadly include Wireless Communication, Electromagnetics, and 3D Computer Vision. My current research focuses on building real-time AR/VR systems for resource constrained environments, with the main objective of reducing latency while preserving a satisfactory visual quality.

Before joining the PhD program, I was an exchange student at <a href='https://iitk.ac.in/'>IIT Kanpur</a> from December 2019 to June 2020, where I worked with <a href='https://home.iitk.ac.in/~kvs/phd.php'>Prof. K.V. Srivastava</a> in the field of Metamaterial Absorbers.
